Math,Algebra,Linear/Quadratic Equations,"A company manufactures rectangular boxes with a length that is 3 inches more than the width and a height that is 2 inches less than the width. If the volume of the box is 60 cubic inches, we need to find the dimensions.","What are the dimensions of the box?","Width: 3 in, Length: 6 in, Height: 1 in","Width: 4 in, Length: 7 in, Height: 2 in","Width: 5 in, Length: 8 in, Height: 3 in","Width: 2 in, Length: 5 in, Height: 0 in",B,"Let w = width. Then length = w + 3 and height = w - 2. Volume = w(w + 3)(w - 2) = 60. Solving gives w = 4.",Medium
Reading and Writing,Information and Ideas,Central Ideas and Details,"The concept of artificial intelligence has evolved significantly since its inception in the 1950s. Early researchers believed that machines could be programmed to think like humans within a few decades. However, the complexity of human cognition proved far greater than initially anticipated. Today, AI systems excel in specific domains but still lack the general intelligence that characterizes human thinking.","Which choice completes the text with the most logical and precise word or phrase?","remarkable","significant","ordinary","questionable",B,"The context suggests that the development was noteworthy and important, making 'significant' the most appropriate choice.",Medium
Math,Advanced Math,Functions,"In a coordinate plane, a parabola opens upward with its vertex at (-2, -8). The parabola passes through the point (1, 1). We need to determine the equation of this parabola and find where it intersects the x-axis.","What is the equation of the parabola?","y = (x + 2)² - 8","y = (x - 2)² + 8","y = x² + 4x + 4","y = x² - 4x - 4",A,"Using vertex form y = a(x - h)² + k with vertex (-2, -8) and point (1, 1), we can solve for a = 1.",Hard
